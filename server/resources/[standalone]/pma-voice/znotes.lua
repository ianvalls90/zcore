fix the config variables 
    set voice_useNativeAudio true
    set voice_useSendingRangeOnly true maybe if it's not buggy
    set voice_enableUi 0 ?
    set voice_defaultCycle to a key that makes sense and wont conflict
    set voice_enableSubmix 1
    set voice_enableRadioAnim 

    change voice_defaultRadio from left alt as that will be used by bt-target

    voice_syncData 1 .. maybe?
